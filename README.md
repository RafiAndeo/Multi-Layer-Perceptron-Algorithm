## What is it?

**pandas** is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way towards this goal.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as
    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and
    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional
    objects
  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can
    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply
    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically
    align the data for you in computations
  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform
    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating
    and transforming data
  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,
    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures
    into DataFrame objects
  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy
    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of
    large data sets
  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data
    sets
  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of
    data sets
  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple
    labels per tick)
  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]
    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],
    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]
  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range
    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,
    date shifting and lagging

# Introduction to matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

**Considerations**:

- The figure is the window or general page in which everything is drawn. You can create multiple independent figures. A figure can have other things, like a subtitle, which is a centered title of the figure, a legend, a color bar...

- Axes are added to the figure. The axes are the area in which the data is graphed with functions such as `plot()` and `scatter()`, and can have associated labels.

- Each axis has an x-axis and a y-axis, and each contains a numbering.

   There are also the labels of the axes, the title, and the legend that must be taken into account when you want to customize the axes, but also taking into account that the scales of the axes and the grid lines can be useful.

- The vertebral lines are lines that connect the axis marks and designate the boundaries of the data area, in other words, they are the simple square that you can see when you have initialized.

- **matplotlib** is the entire Python data display package.

- **pyplot** is a module in the matplotlib package. The module provides an interface that allows you to create shapes and axes implicitly and automatically to achieve the desired frame.

- Machine learning **data** for graphing on matplotlib **should be structured under the numpy library**.

# How to create graphics with matplotlib

`Matplotlib` allows you to create different graphics. The possible types and examples links are mentioned below:

seaborn: statistical data visualization
=======================================

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/seaborn.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/seaborn.svg)](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/master/LICENSE)

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.


Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).

The docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.

To build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).

Dependencies
------------

Seaborn supports Python 3.7+ and no longer supports Python 2.

Installation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).


Installation
------------

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install seaborn

It is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies (only relevant for v0.12+):

    pip install seaborn[stats]

Seaborn can also be installed with conda:

    conda install seaborn

Note that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.

Citing
------

A paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.

Testing
-------

Testing seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).

To test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.

Code style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.

Development
-----------

Seaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn

Please submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem. Questions about usage are more at home on StackOverflow, where there is a [seaborn tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn).

**scikit-learn** is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the `About us <https://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#authors>`__ page
for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.
